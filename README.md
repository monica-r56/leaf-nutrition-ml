# Classification of leaves based on healthiness & nutrition efficiency using Machine Learning
**Step 1:** Collected the leaf images in real-time dynamicaaly using the mobile camera for training and testing\n
**Step 2:** Train-Test split ratio of 8:2 (80% for training & 20% for testing)
**Step 3:** Define the CNN model architecture 
**Step 4:** Fit the training datasets in the model and run it for 10 epochs
**Step 5:** Evaluate the model with the testing dataset 
**Step 6:** Finetune the model for achieving higher accuracy
**Step 7:** Deploy the model
